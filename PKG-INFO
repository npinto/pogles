Description: pogles - Python Bindings for OpenGL ES v2.0
        ===========================================
        
        What is pogles?
        ---------------
        
        pogles is a Python package that implements bindings for OpenGL ES v2.0 for
        Python v2.3 or later and Python v3.  It comprises three modules:
        
        - ``pogles.gles2`` contains the bindings for Open GL ES v2.0 itself.
        
        - ``pogles.egl`` contains the bindings for the EGL native platform interface.
        
        - ``pogles.platform`` contains platform specific bindings for creating native
          windows.  Currently the Raspberry Pi and X11 platforms are supported.
        
        The full ES and EGL APIs are implemented and given a Pythonic twist where
        appropriate - for example errors raise Python exceptions.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        pogles is implemented using the SIP Python bindings generator which must be
        installed first.  SIP is available for all Linux distributions but pogles
        requires v4.14.2 or later.  The current version of SIP can be found at
        http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/sip/download.
        
        pogles itself is installed as a normal Python package::
        
            python setup.py install
